<h1>JWIIGG</h1> 


<p>Hi this is my website. </p>

<p>find me:
    on bluesky: @jwiigg.bsky.social
    on instagram: @jwiigg
    infrequently updating twitter: @jwiigg
</p>

<p>But I'd prefer if you visited this site every once in a while. 
    (I will get a domain name soon. Most likely jwiigg.com or whatever is cheapest)
    For now this is an invitation to some of the projects that I'm working on:
</p>

<h1>HALCYONAUTS</h1>  <p>shortfilm</p>
<img src="Pose1" alt="Two figures playing Racquetball" width="500" height="600">
<p>A crew of astronauts carrying the venture through pounds of sulfur, paranoia, and fatigue.
    They aim to exhume a dying moon for its secrets of life, 
    but must first survive the wraiths that reside beneath the molten regolith.
</p>

<h1>SCOOTER'S CARNIVAL</h1>
<img src="ReaperB" alt="Figure in leather jacket leaning against a bike" width="500" height="600">
<p>At RADIAL DUNGEON: a blend of action and roleplaying elements set in a dreamlike world. 
    The player will dive into the dark and eerie atmosphere of an island 
    where they must trend the lines of reality and the supernatural.</p>

<p>I work in Blender. If you want to learn, here's an outdated doc (I will update it soon): 
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kZB1kXbLY_UJv7DCQkxiMqcP58cEmVHvxADtCnsUAzQ/edit?usp=sharing
    
    I think this site is the best way for me to make more consious decisions online 
    I might start newsletter?
    I don't know email me: jwiigg@proton.me
